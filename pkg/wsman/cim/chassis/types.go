The Tag property can contain information such as asset tag or serial number data. The key for PhysicalElement is placed very high in the object hierarchy in order to independently identify the hardware or entity, regardless of physical placement in or on Cabinets, Adapters, and so on. For example, a hotswappable or removable component can be taken from its containing (scoping) Package and be temporarily unused. The object still continues to exist and can even be inserted into a different scoping container. Therefore, the key for Physical Element is an arbitrary string and is defined independently of any placement or location-oriented hierarchy.

The numeric values are consistent with CIM's enum numbering guidelines, but are slightly different than the MIB's values.
